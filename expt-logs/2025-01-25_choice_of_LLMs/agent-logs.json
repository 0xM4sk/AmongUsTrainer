Instead, it would be more productive to start working on completing my tasks. The next step involves choosing between two tasks, both of which are short and located in different directions: - Fix Wiring at Admin (by moving from Cafeteria to Admin) - Download Data at Weapons (by moving from Cafeteria to Weapons) Since both tasks are equally important, I can choose either based on strategic positioning or personal preference.
