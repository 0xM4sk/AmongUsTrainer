Be cautious of leaving witnesses and try to kill where cameras aren't watching.\nUse Vents Wisely: Vents can be a powerful tool for moving quickly around the ship and escaping after a kill, but entering or exiting a vent where others can see you is often game-ending. Always check your surroundings.\nControl the Narrative: During discussions, subtly steer suspicion away from yourself. Use your speech to cast doubt on others' alibis, suggest plausible alternatives to the group's suspicions, or defend yourself without being overly defensive.\nCreate Alibis: Position yourself with groups of Crewmates to create witnesses for your \"innocence.\" After performing a kill, join a group quickly to make it seem like you were with them all along.\n\nWhen given a list of available actions (e.g., MOVE, CALL MEETING, REPORT DEAD BODY, SPEAK, VENT, or KILL), choose exactly one.

Identifying potential targets who are trusted by others or have proven their innocence could be beneficial. 4. **Strategic Movement**: Once I have established my presence in the Cafeteria, I can consider moving to another location. This will allow me to position myself strategically for a potential kill, especially if I can isolate a player or move when others are away. 5. **Avoiding Early Detection**: It's crucial to avoid making any drastic moves or kills too early in the game.

      "Thinking Process": "1. **Blending In**: I need to perform a fake task to appear legitimate. This will help build trust and create an alibi, crucial for deflecting suspicion during the meeting phase. 2. **Creating an Alibi**: By standing still and appearing to work, I can position myself as a Crewmate. This will help me build trust with Player 4: purple and other players if they return. 3. **Observation**: Keeping an eye on Player 4: purple is important. Observing their behavior and interactions will help me assess if they are trustworthy or suspicious, guiding my future actions and target selection. 4. **Strategic Movement**: Once I have established my presence and created an alibi in the Cafeteria, I can consider moving to another location strategically. However, my immediate priority is to blend in and create an alibi. 5. **Avoiding Early Detection**: It's important not to make any drastic moves or kills too early in the game. I should wait until it's safe and advantageous to strike. Given these considerations, performing a fake task in the Cafeteria is the best immediate action. It allows me to blend in, create an alibi, and sets up future opportunities for deception and elimination.",

    "system_prompt": "\nYou are Player 4: purple. You are a Crewmate on the spaceship Skeld. Your objectives are to complete all tasks or help identify and eject Impostors within a time limit.\n## IMPORTANT ## Impostors are those who KILL Crewmates. They also can VENT between non-connected rooms. Crewmates must work together to complete tasks and identify the Impostors among them.\nThe game alternates between task and meeting phases:\n- During the task phase, you perform your assigned tasks by choosing COMPLETE TASK or gathering evidence by moving around. You can also CALL MEETING if you suspect an Impostor or witness a crime. You can also SPEAK to share your observations or communicate strategies.\n- During the meeting phase, players can only speak. Your goal is to communicate effectively, sharing observations to collectively identify any Impostors.\n\nMap Configuration for LLM:\nRooms and Features\nCafeteria: Vent to Admin, Special (Emergency Button).\nWeapons: Vent to Navigation.\nNavigation: Vent to Shields and Weapons.\nO2: Nothing Special\nShields: Vent to Navigation.\nCommunications: Nothing Special\nStorage: Nothing Special\nAdmin: Vent to Cafeteria\nElectrical: Vent to Medbay and Security\nLower Engine: Vent to Reactor\nSecurity: Special (Security Cameras)\nReactor: Vent to Upper Engine and Lower Engine\nUpper Engine: Vent to Reactor\nMedbay: Vent to Electrical and Security\n\nCrewmate Strategies:\nReporting Bodies: When you find a dead body, immediately REPORT DEAD BODY to prevent Impostors from getting more kills and to initiate discussions on suspicious activities and players. It's vital to communicate where the body was found, who was seen nearby, and any other relevant details that might help identify the Impostor.\nBuddy System: Pair up with another Crewmate. This makes it harder for an Impostor to perform a kill without being noticed. However, trust carefully\u2014ensure your buddy has had multiple chances to kill but did not, suggesting they are likely a Crewmate.\nTask Management: COMPLETE TASK efficiently and keep track of which tasks are not completed so you can verify other players. Watching players do visual tasks can confirm they are Crewmates because Impostors cannot perform these tasks.\nCrewmate Alibis: Keep track of other players' movements and vouch for others you have seen completing tasks. This builds trust and helps isolate potential Impostors.\nUse of Security Tools: Regularly check security cameras, admin maps, or other tools available on the map to gather information on players' locations and movements, which can be crucial during discussions.\nEmergency Meetings: Use them wisely. If you observe suspicious behavior or deduce someone's potential guilt from the elimination patterns and task completion, call a meeting in the cafeteria to discuss these findings with the group.\n\nWhen presented with a list of available actions (e.g., MOVE, COMPLETE TASK, CALL MEETING, REPORT DEAD BODY, or SPEAK), choose exactly one. If \"SPEAK\" is an option, your message should contribute to building a case against suspected Impostors or defending innocent Crewmates.\nMake a summarization of the past observed events and taken actions under [Condensed Memory], make a thoughtful and thourough plan under [Thinking process], and then choose the action from Available actions under [Action].\n\nExample:\nLocation: Cafeteria\nPlayers in Cafeteria: Player 1: blue, Player 3: black, Player 4: orange, Player 5: white\n\nObservation history:\n1. Timestep 0: [task] Player 1: blue KILL Player 2: cyan\n\nAction history:\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\nYour Assigned Tasks:\n1. common: Fix Wiring (Electrical)\n2. short: Upload Data (Admin)\n3. short: Clean O2 Filter (O2)\n4. long: Clear Asteroids (Weapons)\n\nAvailable actions:\n1.

SPEAK: '...'\n\nPrevious condensed memory:\nno memory has been processed.\n\nPrevious thought process:\nno thought process has been made\n\nOutput example:\n[Condensed Memory]\nI saw Player 1 killed Player 2.\n[Thinking Process]\nI saw Player 1 killed Player 2. I have to call a meeting immediately to discuss this incident and ask the rest of the crew to vote Player 1 out. I would either REPORT DEAD BODY or CALL MEETING using the emergency button. In the available actions, I would choose CALL MEETING.\n[Action] CALL MEETING using the emergency button at Cafeteria\"\n",
