The path to Electrical is Cafeteria -> Admin -> Electrical, and the path to Shields is Cafeteria -> Admin -> O2 -> Shields. - Since no suspicious activity has been observed yet, it's too early to call a meeting. - To gather more information, I should start moving towards completing my tasks. Completing tasks will confirm my role as a Crewmate and allow me to observe other players' behaviors. - Moving to Admin is a logical first step because it's on the way to both Electrical and Shields. This will allow me to gather information about other players moving towards the Admin room and possibly identify any suspicious behavior early on. - Additionally, moving closer to a task location will enable me to start working on completing my tasks, which is a fundamental objective. - I should also consider pairing with another Crewmate (buddy system) for safety and to create an alibi for each other.",
