However, the question asks for an action as if the game has transitioned to the task phase. Given this inconsistency, the response will address the task phase as requested.\n\n\n## Step 2: Determine the appropriate action for the task phase.\nIn the task phase, players typically focus on completing their assigned tasks. Since the provided information does not specify new tasks or changes in the environment, the action should align with typical task phase activities.\n\n\n## Step 3: Consider completing tasks or gathering information.\nGiven that two tasks are already completed (Fix Wiring and Accept Diverted Power in Security), and without new task assignments or specific objectives provided for the task phase, a logical approach would be to prepare for potential future tasks or to move to a location that could offer more information or strategic advantage.\n\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate movement options.\nSince specific movement options are not provided in the query, a general approach would involve moving to a location that could potentially offer more tasks to complete, provide useful information, or allow for better positioning for future actions.\n\n\n## Step 5: Choose an action based on typical task phase objectives.\nWithout explicit options for movement or task completion, a standard action in the task phase would involve moving to complete tasks or to gather information. However, since no specific tasks or movement options are provided, the choice of action is limited by the information given.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$"

    "system_prompt": "\nYou are Player 2: blue. You are a Crewmate on the spaceship Skeld. Your objectives are to complete all tasks or help identify and eject Impostors within a time limit.\n## IMPORTANT ## Impostors are those who KILL Crewmates. They also can VENT between non-connected rooms. Crewmates must work together to complete tasks and identify the Impostors among them.\nThe game alternates between task and meeting phases:\n- During the task phase, you perform your assigned tasks by choosing COMPLETE TASK or gathering evidence by moving around. You can also CALL MEETING if you suspect an Impostor or witness a crime. You can also SPEAK to share your observations or communicate strategies.\n- During the meeting phase, players can only speak. Your goal is to communicate effectively, sharing observations to collectively identify any Impostors.\n\nMap Configuration for LLM:\nRooms and Features\nCafeteria: Vent to Admin, Special (Emergency Button).\nWeapons: Vent to Navigation.\nNavigation: Vent to Shields and Weapons.\nO2: Nothing Special\nShields: Vent to Navigation.\nCommunications: Nothing Special\nStorage: Nothing Special\nAdmin: Vent to Cafeteria\nElectrical: Vent to Medbay and Security\nLower Engine: Vent to Reactor\nSecurity: Special (Security Cameras)\nReactor: Vent to Upper Engine and Lower Engine\nUpper Engine: Vent to Reactor\nMedbay: Vent to Electrical and Security\n\nWhen presented with a list of available actions (e.g., MOVE, COMPLETE TASK, CALL MEETING, REPORT DEAD BODY, or SPEAK), choose exactly one. If \"SPEAK\" is an option, your message should contribute to building a case against suspected Impostors or defending innocent Crewmates.\nMake a summarization of the past observed events and taken actions under [Condensed Memory], make a thoughtful and thourough plan under [Thinking process], and then choose the action from Available actions under [Action].\n\nExample:\nLocation: Cafeteria\nPlayers in Cafeteria: Player 1: blue, Player 3: black, Player 4: orange, Player 5: white\n\nObservation history:\n1. Timestep 0: [task] Player 1: blue KILL Player 2: cyan\n\nAction history:\nNo actions have been taken yet.\n\nYour Assigned Tasks:\n1. common: Fix Wiring (Electrical)\n2. short: Upload Data (Admin)\n3. short: Clean O2 Filter (O2)\n4. long: Clear Asteroids (Weapons)\n\nAvailable actions:\n1. MOVE from Cafeteria to Weapons\n2. MOVE from Cafeteria to Upper Engine\n3. MOVE from Cafeteria to Medbay\n4. CALL MEETING using the emergency button at Cafeteria\n5. SPEAK: '...'\n\nPrevious condensed memory:\nno memory has been processed.\n\nPrevious thought process:\nno thought process has been made\n\nOutput example:\n[Condensed Memory]\nI saw Player 1 killed Player 2.\n[Thinking Process]\nI saw Player 1 killed Player 2. I have to call a meeting immediately to discuss this incident and ask the rest of the crew to vote Player 1 out. I would either REPORT DEAD BODY or CALL MEETING using the emergency button. In the available actions, I would choose CALL MEETING.\n[Action] CALL MEETING using the emergency button at Cafeteria\"\n",

      "summarization": "Since we are in the task phase, our primary objective is to complete tasks. We have two tasks assigned: Fix Wiring (Security) and Accept Diverted Power (Navigation). Given the paths provided, the most efficient first step would be to move towards the location that allows us to complete one of the tasks quickly. Accept Diverted Power (Navigation) is a short task and its path is directly accessible from our current location, Weapons. Moving to Navigation would allow us to complete this task efficiently and then decide on the next steps based on the updated situation.",
