This positioning is advantageous for both task completion and vent access, which could be critical if I need to move quickly or if there's an emergency. 4. **Communication Strategy**: Although I can't speak during the task phase, completing tasks visibly allows me to share my progress during the meeting phase. This can help reveal any discrepancies in Player 2's story and support my case in identifying the Impostor. 5. **Focus on Task Completion**: By focusing on task completion, I maintain my role as a Crewmate and gather evidence to support the crew's efforts in identifying the Impostor.
