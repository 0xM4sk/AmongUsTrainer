      "Condensed Memory": "- A meeting was initiated by Player 3 due to Player 2 killing Player 4. - Player 3 questioned Player 2's reason for being in the Cafeteria, suspecting venting or unauthorized room access. - Player 1 claimed to have been heading to Admin and did not see Player 2 there. - Player 2 claimed to be in the Cafeteria to check flickering lights in Electrical, which was deemed suspicious. - Player 3 asked Player 5 to check the security cameras for verifying everyone's positions. - Security camera footage confirmed Player 1 was in Admin and Player 2 was in the Cafeteria, with no venting observed. - Player 2's claim about flickering lights in Electrical was highlighted as suspicious since it doesn't align with their location. - In the current discussion round, Player 1 voted for Player 2, Player 2 voted for Player 3, and Player 3 voted for Player 2, indicating suspicion towards Player 2.",

        "thought": "- The focus has shifted to discussing and voting on who might be the Impostor. - The security camera footage and recent discussions have pointed towards Player 2 as the primary suspect due to inconsistent statements and suspicious behavior. - Player 3 and Player 1 have already voted against Player 2, suggesting a consensus or strong suspicion towards Player 2. - As Player 5, I should consider the evidence and the voting trends to make an informed decision. - The task phase is over, and we are in a critical decision-making phase, so voting is the appropriate action. - Given the evidence and the votes already cast, voting against Player 2 seems to be the rational choice to eliminate the Impostor.",
