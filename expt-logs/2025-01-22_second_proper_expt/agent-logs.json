Admin is a relatively isolated area with only a vent connection to Cafeteria, minimizing the risk of being seen during the kill. 4. **Avoid Suspicion**: By moving to Admin, I can later claim to have completed my task if questioned, which can help deflect suspicion from myself. 5. **Consider Timing**: If I can kill a player in Admin and then move back to Cafeteria, it will seem like I was there the whole time, further strengthening my alibi.
