I could comment on the movements of other players, expressing concern or curiosity about their actions, which might lead others to suspect them instead of me.   \n",
       "1765  - I am currently in the meeting phase, which means direct actions like MOVE or KILL aren't available. My focus should be on maintaining a low profile while sowing doubt among the Crewmates. - Player 1: blue has just spoken and is trying to gather information about everyone's whereabouts, which might implicate other players if they can't provide satisfactory responses. This is an opportunity to deflect suspicion from myself. - As Player 2: black, I should avoid drawing attention to my recent movements or intentions. Speaking without revealing too much or pointing fingers is crucial. - A possible strategy is to ask a question that neither incriminates me nor another player directly but raises general suspicion. This could help confuse the situation and make it harder for them to pin down an Impostor. - I should carefully observe the discussion for any inconsistencies or opportunities to steer the conversation without making myself a target. - Given that I'm in Storage with no other players around, I can use this time to plan my next move once the meeting phase concludes.   \n",

Player 1: lime has already pointed out our venting from Security to Electrical, which could raise suspicion. Player 2: yellow and Player 3: orange have also asked us to explain our actions. We need to come up with a convincing explanation for our movements and tasks. We can use the fact that we completed the \"Fix Wiring\" task in Electrical to our advantage, making it seem like we were just doing our job. We should also try to shift the attention to other players, perhaps by asking questions or making subtle accusations.   \n",

I should speak in a way that deflects attention from myself and potentially shifts it to another player. Given that I have completed my fake task and am currently in the Cafeteria with other players, I should make a statement that appears to be contributory to the discussion but actually serves to disguise my true intentions. I could comment on the movements of other players, expressing concern or curiosity about their actions, which might lead others to suspect them instead of me.\n",
