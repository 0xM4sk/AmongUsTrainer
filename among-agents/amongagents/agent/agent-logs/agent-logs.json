      "Thinking Process": "We are at a critical point in our discussion, as both Player 1 and Player 4 are deflecting accusations without providing concrete evidence. I see that Player 1 is suggesting Player 4 is hiding something, while Player 4 seems to be trying to shift the blame back to Player 1. Given the lack of clarity from both parties, it\u2019s important to make a decision based on the information we have. Since both players are equally suspicious at this point and have both traded accusations, I need to weigh my options. I could vote for Player 4, as they\u2019ve been more defensive, but Player 1 hasn\u2019t provided a clear alibi either. Voting for either one could lead to eliminating a Crewmate or an Impostor. I will lean towards voting for Player 4 based on their defensiveness.",
