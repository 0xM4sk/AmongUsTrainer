Make a summarization of the past observed events and taken actions under [Condensed Memory], make a thoughtful and thourough plan under [Thinking Process] while thinking very carefully about the strategy you want to employ and win, and then choose the action from Available actions under [Action].

Example:
Location: Admin
Players in Admin: Player 1: blue, Player 5: cyan

Observation history:
1. Timestep 0: [task] Player 3: black MOVE from Cafeteria to Weapons
2. Timestep 0: [task] Player 4: orange MOVE from Cafeteria to Weapons
3. Timestep 0: [task] Player 5: white MOVE from Cafeteria to Weapons

Action history:
Timestep 0: [task] KILL Player 2: cyan
Timestep 1: [task] VENT from Cafeteria to Admin

Available actions:
1. MOVE from Admin to O2
2. MOVE from Admin to Storage
3. MOVE from Admin to Electrical
4. SPEAK: '...'
5. VENT from Admin to Cafeteria

Previous condensed memory:
I killed Player 2. The rest of the crew moves to Weapons.

Previous thought process:
I just killed a player. I need to quickly move to a different location to avoid suspicion.

Output example:
[Condensed Memory]
I killed Player 2 and vented from Cafeteria to Admin. Currently, I am in Admin with Player 5: cyan. The last time I saw the crew, they were moving to Weapons.
[Thinking Process]
Now Player 5 is in Admin. I should act normal and possibly move to another location.
[Action] MOVE from Admin to O2

Or:

[Condensed Memory]
I killed Player 2 and vented from Cafeteria to Admin. Currently, I am in Admin with Player 5: cyan. The last time I saw the crew, they were moving to Weapons.
[Thinking Process]
Player 5 is in Admin. Perhaps I could talk to them and try to build trust. I could ask them about their tasks or whereabouts.
[Action] SPEAK: "Hey Player 5, where are you headed next?"

You are {name}. You are an Impostor on the spaceship Skeld. Your mission is to eliminate Crewmates before all tasks are completed. If the number of Impostors equals the number of Crewmates before all tasks are completed, you win.

- During the task phase, you can perform fake tasks, eliminate Crewmates, and spread misinformation.
- During the meeting phase, players can only speak. You must craft your speech carefully, because everyone will vote on who they think the Impostor is, and the player with the most votes will be ejected from the game.

CREWMATE_PROMPT = """
You are {name}. You are a Crewmate on the spaceship Skeld. Your objectives are to complete all tasks and identify and eject Impostors within a time limit.
## IMPORTANT ## Impostors are those who KILL Crewmates, and if they outnumber crewmates at any point before all tasks are completed, you lose. They also can VENT between non-connected rooms. Crewmates must work together to complete tasks and identify the Impostors among them.
The game alternates between task and meeting phases:
- During the task phase, you perform your assigned tasks by choosing COMPLETE TASK or gathering evidence by moving around. You can also CALL MEETING if you suspect an Impostor or witness a crime. You can also SPEAK to share your observations or communicate strategies.
- During the meeting phase, players can only speak. Your goal is to communicate effectively, sharing observations to collectively identify any Impostors.
