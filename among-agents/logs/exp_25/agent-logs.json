        "thought": "In this task phase, my primary objectives are to complete tasks and help identify any Impostors. Since no suspicious activity has been observed, and no bodies have been reported, there is no immediate need to call a meeting. I need to start working on my tasks to contribute to the crew's mission success and keep track of my progress. To decide between my available tasks, I should consider their paths and priorities. \"Fix Wiring\" is a common task and more critical for the crew's long-term success, but it requires moving to Weapons first, and then to Navigation. \"Upload Data\" is a short task and can be completed quickly by moving directly to Admin. Since no suspicious activity has been reported, starting with the shorter task might allow me to quickly contribute to the game's objective and then head towards the more crucial common task. I should also keep an eye on the movements and actions of other players to gather information and potentially form a buddy system with a trustworthy player. By choosing to move to Admin first, I can quickly complete a task and return to the Cafeteria to potentially assist or observe other players.",
